## Development notes

I made the decision to use different approaches and technologies to show my skills.

- Used TailwindCSS to handle the basic styles
  - Some sizes can be a little different from Figma, I kept it as close as possible, even knowing that I can override the Tailwind config, I preferred not to do it. 
- Used SCSS to make some basic animations 
- Used RxJs to handle the states
- Used Signals to change detections
  - I could take a time to implement the state handling with Signals but I prefer to use RxJs to show more skills
- Used Firebase Hosting to host the project
